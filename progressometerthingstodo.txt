More stuff to do for the progress-o-meter:
Should display the finishing date (which will be based on how many days left, so it will be adjusted if one day, no entry is made)
Should include a button to directly inputting a number of days (of one/more have been forgotten, or too many have accidently been typed)
Make "1 more day!"-button sit further up on a screen
Handling all exeption cases, i.e. user says they have a name, but it does not exist, or user don't put in a name, etc.
Make one of the radio-buttons be chosen by default
Print motivational/encouraging quotes which prints when user pushes one more day button
When user reaches day goal, it should first of all not be possible to click button anymore. It should also be celebrated with some animation
Settings: Change colors, Change day goal from 100 to other thing number of days.
